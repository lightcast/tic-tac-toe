# tic-tac-toe


I made this game becauseI was doing a course on the <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.
The requirements were for you to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript. I took it a little further and made a simple Ai.

You can choose to play: 2Player or You VS The Computer.

Here are the simple guidelines for the Ai in order:

- if the center is available, take it
- if there is a possibility of a win, take it
- if there is a block, take it
- if any of the the corners are available, take it randomly
- if any of the middle edges (i.e positions 1,3,5,7) are available, take it randomly

This is a simple AI but in order for it not to be draw every time I allow the human(you) to take the first move.
If you know anything about tic-tac-toe you will know to take the middle square which would improve your chances of winning.
It is possible to win. I design this game without using minimax for that reason. Give it a try.

That's it. Take a look at the code.
